# Weather-App
You can search which city/state you want and will be able to determine the weather type and temp and get advice.

1. We first Needed to get an API key from the Website - https://openweathermap.org/api
   The Reason for this is to get all the information we will need in order to actually get the info needed for the weather app.

2. After we had to install Requests onto our environment which made it easy to access the web API

3. I then set some things equal to varibales I came up with to make things run smoothly and developed with if else statments to meet ceratin parameters.

4. This all allowed me to run the Weather "APP" nicely.
